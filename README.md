# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is B2B / SAAS application or digital, sociopolitical or economic system that can scale to include more than one person or business within the same policy, forum or service.

The current "human" sociopoltical or economic system is analogue, where the responsibility for managing polices, forums or services is delegated to a single person, tribe or organisation.

For example a politician creating a bill to enter into parliament. [Policy]

A bank who provies a financial network to enable service providers to buy or sell goods or services from another. [Forum]

Or a family bakery deciding to franchise their business to service more customers. [Service]

Eleutherios breaks this pattern of a one-to-one or one-to-many type of relationship to a many-to-many relationship.

Eleutherios provides tools that enable people or businesses to:

- Create policies together
- Create rules for policies
- Communicate with one another through forums
- Join or leave forums
- Create services
- Consume policies
- Change the permissions of managers managing policies
- Change the permissions of services serving in forums

Subsequent versions:

- Charge customers and make payments
- Create software applications or dynamic services
