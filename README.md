# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is B2B SASS application or digital, sociopolitical or economic system that enables people or its end users to create policies, forums and services together.

The current "human" sociopoltical or economic system is analogue, where the responsibility for managing polices, services or forums is delegated to a single person, tribe, organisation or company.

This way of managing policies, forums or services doesn't scale, because nobody else can join or help manage it.

In the first version of Eleutherios:

- Create / consume policies
- Create rules for policies
- Create forums
- Join forums
- Create services
- Manage policy permissions
- Manage service permissions
- Post messages

Subsequent versions:

- Purchase services
- Create Apps or dynamic services
