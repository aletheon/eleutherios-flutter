# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is a digital, sociopolitical or economic system that enables people or its end users to create policies, forums and services together.

The current "human" sociopoltical or economic system is analogue, where the duties of managing polices, services or forums is the responsibility of a single person, tribe, organisation or company.

This way of operating doesn't scale, because nobody else can manage the same policy, forum or service.
