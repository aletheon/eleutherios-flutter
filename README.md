# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is a digital, sociopolitical or economic system that enables people or its end users to create policies, services and forums together.

The current "human" sociopoltical or economic system is analogue, where the duties of managing polices, services or forums is the responsibility of a single person, tribe, organisation or company.

This way of managing human sociopolitical or economic affairs doesn't scale and is preventing humanity from operating as a collective or teno rangatira tanga.
