# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is a smart phone application that enables SMEs or stakeholders within any industry to cooperate with one another through the same policy, forum or service layer.

The current human sociopolitical or economic system is linear where stakeholders communicate with one another through a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.

Eleutherios disrupts this behavior by digitizing the network layer and turning it into a forum or bidirectional network or many-to-many relationship among stakeholders.

Eleutherios provides tools that enable people or businesses to:

- Create policies together
- Create rules for policies
- Share information or data through forums
- Join or leave forums
- Create services
- Consume policies
- Change the permissions of managers managing policies
- Change the permissions of services serving in forums

Subsequent versions:

- Charge customers and make payments
- Create software applications or dynamic services
