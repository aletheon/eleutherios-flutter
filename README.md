# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is a smart phone application that enables SMEs or stakeholders within any industry to cooperate with one another through the same policy, forum or service layer.

The current human sociopolitical or economic system is linear where stakeholders communicate with one another through a one-to-one or one-to-many network relationship.

Eleutherios disrupts this behavior by digitizing the network and turning it into a forum or bidirectional, many-to-many network relationship.

Eleutherios provides tools that enable people or businesses to:

- Create policies together
- Create rules for policies
- Consume policies
- Serve in the same network or forum together
- Share information or data through forums
- Create services
- Change the permissions of managers managing policies
- Change the permissions of services serving in forums

Subsequent versions:

- Charge customers and make payments
- Create software applications or dynamic services
