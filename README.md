# Eleutherios

Eleutherios is a smart phone application that enables SMEs or stakeholders within any industry (e.g. healthcare, construction and machinery, food, education, housing, energy etc) to cooperate with one another through the same policy, forum or service layer.

The current human sociopolitical or economic system is linear where stakeholders communicate with one another through a one-to-one or one-to-many network relationship.

Eleutherios disrupts this behavior by digitizing the network layer and turning it into a forum or bidirectional, many-to-many network relationship.

Eleutherios provides tools that enable people or both public and private businesses to:

- Create policies together
- Create rules for policies
- Consume policies
- Serve in the same network or forum together
- Share information or data through forums
- Create services
- Grant managers permissions to manage policies
- Grant members permissions to manage forums

Subsequent versions:

- Enable stakeholders to charge customers or make payments to one another
- Enable PAAS to allow for stakeholders to leverage their existing assets such as data and business logic on their own servers.  Allowing for IoT, virtual services etc.
- Enable ML to automate policy creation, service creation etc.
